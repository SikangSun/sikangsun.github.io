Every country in the world possesses such a system, with the aim of developing the minds of the upcoming generation. This system, so immense in size, so dense in complexity, practiced cross-culturally, unequivocally, and undisputedly, what in the world can possibly require validation? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">In my estimation: about everything. By everything, I mean its fundamental purpose, which like many other intrinsic systems that we have incorporated into our lives, many people were never required to learn their purpose, and perhaps for good reasons, one being their terrible complexities. However, for one to change something for the better, one must break components down into their most essential truths, an approach that is fundamental to fields such as physics and mathematics (and of course, computer science for my case, for it is built upon the foundation of discrete mathematics). With these irrefutable truths, one then may be able to aim with something more steady at hand. And it is for this, after it all, I have come to the terrible conclusion, that it is as if the only way to validate the education system is to invalidate it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">By no means do I think the current system should be forcibly torn down by artificial forces of any kind. However, I am not unbiased for I am honest about my frustration against this current system, in which I have the privilege of participating. In fact, if not for this frustration, I would have never bothered to write down a single letter to express my dissatisfaction, for there would be no dissatisfaction to spew. But before so, there are parameters that I would like to define clearly. First, I would not go into the social, economical, and even political criticisms of the current system, albeit there are many, of which I have a lot less confident speaking about, and there already exist solid arguments made against them. Second, I would solely be speaking about collegiate education, more specifically, undergraduate level, perhaps even graduate (albeit I don&rsquo;t have personal experience), for they are both in the same system, public and private alike, and of which I am currently apart of. Third, I would like to attempt to bring forth an argument that identifies a particular problem, and the last thing it should be is a cheap jab at the enormously complex system that has nurtured and will nurture millions of citizens. And hopefully by focusing on identifying the problem, it will, in turn, avoid the last thing I would like this essay to become.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">\/</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It seems to me to begin the topic of education statement, we need to start else where, at the nature of knowledge. However, the nature of knowledge is broad topic, hence I will only mention that portion I think that related to the subject at hand. The concept of knowledge is a human construct, as knowledge will not exist without human ignorance. Let us imagine an image of all possible knowledge. The image is mostly covered with dark shade, representing the unknown, of which in the middle is an area of of no particular shape that is bright and white, the known (although the relative size between the known and unknown is not imaginable). We can interpret the bright area as the abstraction of the summation of all known human knowledge. As humans discover the universe, the area of known grows, converting the chaotic unknown into the ordered known territories. We can also abstract the idea into in a multidimensional context, where each dimension can be interpreted as a field of study (eg. physics, mathematics, psychology, etc), albeit there is no absolute way of categorizing every field. In that sense, each dimension will represent the amount of knowledge a field of study contains. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This abstraction can then be applied onto the context of an individual. Because the area of human knowledge is the summation of all possible human knowledge, the area of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge will be a subset of that, and one can reasonably infer, that the area of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge is much lesser than that of the total summation of human beings. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>On the scale of an individual, it&rsquo;s much easier to conduct thought experiments. Imagine you are in a class in high school, let say algebra. Then learning the ecludean coordinates and different graphs will expand one&rsquo;s domain in the dimension of mathematics. However, knowledge in mathematics isn&rsquo;t the only thing that is growing. Excercises that help build knowledge in certain domain may also help with one&rsquo;s problem solving skills, refines one&rsquo;s thinking process, or develop one&rsquo;s capability in thinking, writing, and speaking</span><span>, These abilities, although are not strictly fields of knowledge themselves, are crucial to one&rsquo;s success in career and life.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The gained knowledge, especially the foundational knowledge that I like to refer as &ldquo;school of thought&rdquo;, helps interpret the complexity of the world. When one has an enough pool of one &ldquo;school of thought&rdquo; that of any field of study (eg. philosophy, physics, mathematics), one can then see the world through the built knowledge and interpret accordingly. This is where specialization of knowledge comes in, where people can offer different points of views to problems that lie in many dimensions of fields of studies.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">As mentioned that the gained knowledge helps interpret the complexity of the world, another effect of knowledge is the lifting of abstractions. I have personal experiences as a computer science student. When I took computer science in high school, it was introductory coding. There were layers of abstractions of which we are learning on, and as I learned more and more in college, these abstractions were peeled away bit by bit, like what how high level pogramming languages are compiled in to assembly, how the operating system runs those assemly instructions, and how hardware devices acts accordingly to machin code. The concept of abstraction is essential to computer science. This abstraction lets ordinary people of no experience in computers able to use user interfaces on their devices and carry out tasks that efficiently speed up their work productivity, yet have no knowledge of what is happening beneath the screen. It&rsquo;s strange to think that we can operate at this layer of abstraction while not worrying, not even that, not realizing we have to worry about the underneath layers and our vast ignorance of the truth beneath the surface. This peeling of abstraction, in some sense, Is exactly what I am doing to the concept of the educational system in this essay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Lastly, knowledge is a tool, unlike some may say &ldquo;knowledge is power&rdquo;. Whether an axe chops a tree or a person is up to the wielder. Furthermore, the expansion of knowledge is a morally neutral phenomenon. The progress in nuclear science, which led to the invention of nuclear weapons, is a pecular subject to categorize morally. Should people stop expanding their knowledge? The answer to that isn&rsquo;t yes or no, but rather I don&rsquo;t see in any way that could happen. If people are going to explore further and further, and it is clear that there are going to be unintended consequences, despite, undoubtly as it has shown, making the world a better place. If such expansion brought humanity to the brink of nuclear war, can one be certain if knowing more wouldn&rsquo;t bring us to a place even more deadly than that? Stopping its track will never an option, nevertheless, I cannot help but frown ever so slightly when I hear one righteously declares his dedication to his journey to the places of unknown knowledge. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">\/</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The educational system has many responsibilities, however, I doubt, almost certainly, that these ideas were built upon consciously, for in some sense these are nothing more than my interpretations. However, after my observations in my everyday life in college, and sometime before that, of how teachers, students, and administrators act, I wish to argue that in other sense, these interpretation are more true than those the intentions that the educational system is built upon (perhaps limited to my school, but I am willing to go and say that it applies to most of American universities, especially public), for intentions and believes do not usually manifest themselves in practice, but very few things are more true than how people act according to the theories behind it all. Hence I decide to go backwards, from how people act to what it truly means. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span>Responsibility is a heavy term, yet ever so lifting, unshakable, and noble. These responsibilities aren&rsquo;t just what the school should do, but rather what it </span><span class="c5">owes</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to the students. Failling to reach these ideals should be considered a moral erring, for the existence of this system requires much resources from the each student, family, alumni, and the government (whom gets their resources from taxe&hellip;. *cough* the people). Such trust lies on a heavy pillar that upholds the social fabric; we know this because politicians speak and preach of funneling money down the drain that is the educational system; and as far as I am concerned, when there is something politicians of both parties preach, such topic is largely accepted as good by the public.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But what specfiically are these responsibilities, other than the obvious answer of &ldquo;educate the studenst&rdquo;? What is it that allows the the public so rightfully entrust the institution and so valuable that cannot be attained anywhere else? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Take the knowledge model spoken of earlier. In short, the education system construct an orderly path way that allows the student to solidify unknown knowledge at the edge of their capability. Each and every class builds on top of some other knowledge, be it basic arithemetic, fluency in language, or knowledge in specific fields. In other words, classes stand on the edge of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge capacity, and provides methods that allow students to learn easier than otherwise (methods such as lectures, homework, worksheets, essays, etc). </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">To understand this idea, one should also understand the art of learning, for it is the foundemental reason why one goes to school. Image a bridge made up solely by ropes (ones that you may find at a playground), however. only the structure exist, where the floor of the bridge is still hardly built. One may consider standing of one side fo the bridge, at a place of known knowledge, where the other side is the unknown, the place you would like to get to. When one takes a class, he is provided the structure of the bridge, however, to fill up the floor, he would need to lay layers of ropes to make a walkway. He can do so by studying, perhaps he will lay a layer by previewing before lecture, another laying of listening attentively during lectures, perhaps another when doing the homework, and another going to professors and teaching assistants to ask for help. With each layer, the birdge becomes more stable, and despite of being made out of ropes, he has less and less chance of falling through an unpatched hole the more or sturdier layers he lays. When he reaches the other side, he can then use his newfound knowledge for something useful or confront a larger and scarier unbuilt bridge.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The process of learning isn&rsquo;t easy, however, a large portion of educational institution&rsquo;s purpose is to provide a framework of which students can proceed the process, in the context of the example, provide the structure where the students can build on top of. If one were to self-learn anyhing, it will largely come from books or the internet, where such structure do not exist, meaning instead of focusing on &ldquo;what to learn&rdquo;, the individual will have to spend a large chunk of time learning &ldquo;where to learn&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to learn&rdquo; instead. Each then, he might fall into well of roadblocks, where such resource does not exist and there is no one he can go to to overcome his niche difficulties. This is what is valuable, in terms of learning, for the education system, for there exist someone that teaches, someone that provides a structure for learning. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I can go on and on about the technicalities and the abstraction of teaching, but for the purpose of understanding the institution, such is enough. This sets the most foundamental responsibility of the education system, and an amendment closely follows this idea, which is: to provide a meta structure of learning the spans over many courses. One can interpret this as the major/minor system in Universities, such as the requirement classes you must take, electives to boarden your horizen of knowledge, order of pre-requisites and high level courses, etc. This is the meta structure that orders the individual class, for knowledge builds upon each other. Imagine the department designing a new major. The designer needs to go through what are the eseential modules of knowledge that students must learn to receive of a degree (a certificate that proves your understanding of knowledge) from the University. He then goes through knowledge that closely tie without each other, and make them into individual classes that takes place in an orderly structure within a predetermined period of time (semesters). Students learn knowledge sequentially through this order of classes with the idea of making sure each class expands the student&rsquo;s understand right beyond the limit of their knowledge, and not some area of unknown that has no relations to what the student previously understand, where he has no approach or tools to utilize to understand what is newly taught.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">This structure is what is valuable about the system, something one can hardly get from anywhere else, something students would sacrifice sleepless nights for, something parents would willing pay a fortune for. This is the main purpose of the current education system. Note that I am positive when the idea of academia is construct, such structures did not exist. The idea of gaining knowledge for future job securely, which is the core mission statement of any University (if an University does not do that, it should and does not exist), is a modern idea, before which (although I have no idea when the transition happened), the idea of gaining knowledge isn&rsquo;t largely about gaining skills about a job, but about gaining knowledge itself. I am in no way saying that learning for job security is a bad thing, however, such a goal is a misled one if you are student, for the other aim is much more elevating, and for reasons I may or may not go into later. This shift marks a change in the purpose of Universities, which largely impacts the role of assessments (quizes and tests).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Let us estalbish the second clause the purpose of Universities: teach students and certify those who are deemed of having a certain amount of knowledge. In this sense, Universities are places of skill training. that provide classes for student for skills that they may need on the job. We can easily prove this idea to be true considering the facts such as those with college degrees have an advantage in job application than those who don&rsquo;t, those with undergraduate and graduate degrees tend to have higher salaries, and the fact that my grandparents constantly ring me about going to college and get a good job. It is a largely culturally accepted idea, and in my estimation, continues to spread in its influence, which in turn devalues the idea of not going into college, which seems to me have come at a cost of &nbsp;inflating the value of college degrees along with the quality of educations, despite the fact it has made current society more educated than ever. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Universities hold a lot of people, subsequently, attention to each individual student is undisputedly divided. Furthermore, in order to certify students of their knowledge, standardized assessments take place to verify students&rsquo; understanding of the course material. These assessments are supposed to evaluate students&rsquo; knowledge, and an entire scale that is accepted across-nationally is created for such evaluation (eg. GPA and the grading scale). A good assessment is supposed to compare the student&rsquo;s current holding knowledge than what is expected from coming out from taking the respective class. Of course, there exist flaws with such approach, but the main constraints are the human and time resources of the Univerisities and the departments, however, it seems like it is largely the most effective approach, after all, it is still in use today in most of the technical class in Universities. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The two responsibilities, in addition to the amendment ot the first, makes up a large portion of what the current education system does. Of course, there are many more things one can say about what Universities do: getting into a grad school or PHD program, making connections and learning social skills, or even acting in place of job security (working for the University), etc. However, the two clauses themselves are enough to get us started on how the current system is failing to live up to their ideals for they are losing sight of them each and every day. With the purpose gone, what is left is nothing more than the cogs of a machine and the meaningless void that it leaves.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c3"><span class="c0">\/</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><div class="c4"><p class="c7"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c0">Notes: One can safely argue that the ability to think, write, and speak requires knowledge to perform those tasks in a refined manner. However, in my understanding, many people can be great thinkers, writers, and speakers without ever gaining the knowledge of how to be one, nor be able to teach it to other people. This is not to say you can not learn to be better at these things, which&nbsp; requires the acquisition of knowledge, however, it is strange to categorize these human capabilities as &quot;knowledge&quot;, although you can, for the they are&nbsp; human ways to process and communicate objective knowledge. All and all, it is a problem of categorization for my model, which for all that I care, is to demonstrate the learning process which I will talk about later. In summary, there isn&#39;t much point of arguing over such things :).</span></p></div></body></html>
