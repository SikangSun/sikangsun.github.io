Every country in the world possesses such a system, with the aim of developing the minds of the upcoming generation. This system, so immense in size, so dense in complexity, practiced cross-culturally, unequivocally, and undisputedly, what in the world can possibly require validation? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">In my estimation: about everything. By everything, I mean its fundamental purpose, which like many other intrinsic systems that we have incorporated into our lives, many people were never required to learn their purpose, and perhaps for good reasons, one being their terrible complexities. However, for one to change something for the better, one must break components down into their most essential truths, an approach that is fundamental to fields such as physics and mathematics (and of course, computer science for my case, for it is built upon the foundation of discrete mathematics). With these irrefutable truths, one then may be able to aim with something more steady at hand. And it is for this, after it all, I have come to the terrible conclusion, that it is as if the only way to validate the education system is to invalidate it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">By no means do I think the current system should be forcibly torn down by artificial forces of any kind. However, I am not unbiased for I am honest about my frustration against this current system, in which I have the privilege of participating. In fact, if not for this frustration, I would have never bothered to write down a single letter to express my dissatisfaction, for there would be no dissatisfaction to spew. But before so, there are parameters that I would like to define clearly. First, I would not go into the social, economical, and even political criticisms of the current system, albeit there are many, of which I have a lot less confident speaking about, and there already exist solid arguments made against them. Second, I would solely be speaking about collegiate education, more specifically, undergraduate level, perhaps even graduate (albeit I don&rsquo;t have personal experience), for they are both in the same system, public and private alike, and of which I am currently apart of. Third, I would like to attempt to bring forth an argument that identifies a particular problem, and the last thing it should be is a cheap jab at the enormously complex system that has nurtured and will nurture millions of citizens. And hopefully by focusing on identifying the problem, it will, in turn, avoid the last thing I would like this essay to become.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">\/</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">It seems to me to begin the topic of education statement, we need to start else where, at the nature of knowledge. However, the nature of knowledge is broad topic, hence I will only mention that portion I think that related to the subject at hand. The concept of knowledge is a human construct, as knowledge will not exist without human ignorance. Let us imagine an image of all possible knowledge. The image is mostly covered with dark shade, representing the unknown, of which in the middle is an area of of no particular shape that is bright and white, the known (although the relative size between the known and unknown is not imaginable). We can interpret the bright area as the abstraction of the summation of all known human knowledge. As humans discover the universe, the area of known grows, converting the chaotic unknown into the ordered known territories. We can also abstract the idea into in a multidimensional context, where each dimension can be interpreted as a field of study (eg. physics, mathematics, psychology, etc), albeit there is no absolute way of categorizing every field. In that sense, each dimension will represent the amount of knowledge a field of study contains. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">This abstraction can then be applied onto the context of an individual. Because the area of human knowledge is the summation of all possible human knowledge, the area of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge will be a subset of that, and one can reasonably infer, that the area of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge is much lesser than that of the total summation of human beings. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span>On the scale of an individual, it&rsquo;s much easier to conduct thought experiments. Imagine you are in a class in high school, let say algebra. Then learning the ecludean coordinates and different graphs will expand one&rsquo;s domain in the dimension of mathematics. However, knowledge in mathematics isn&rsquo;t the only thing that is growing. Excercises that help build knowledge in certain domain may also help with one&rsquo;s problem solving skills, refines one&rsquo;s thinking process, or develop one&rsquo;s capability in thinking, writing, and speaking</span><span>, These abilities, although are not strictly fields of knowledge themselves, are crucial to one&rsquo;s success in career and life.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">The gained knowledge, especially the foundational knowledge that I like to refer as &ldquo;school of thought&rdquo;, helps interpreting the complexity of the world. When one has an enough pool of one &ldquo;school of thought&rdquo; that of any field of study (eg. philosophy, physics, mathematics), one can then see the world through the built knowledge and interpret according. This is where specialization of knowledge comes in, where people can offer different points of views to problems that lies in many dimensions of fields of studies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">As mentioned that the gained knowledge helps interpret the complexity of the world, another effect of knowledge is the lifting of abstraction. I have personal experiences as a computer science student. When I took computer science in high school, it was introductory coding. There were layers of abstractions of which we are learning on, and as I learned more and more in college, these abstractions were peeled away bit by bit, like what how high level pogramming languages are compiled in to assembly, how the operating system runs those instructions, and how hardware devices carry out individual instructions. The concept of abstraction is essential to computer science. This abstraction lets ordinary people of no experience in computer able to use user interfaces on their devices and carry out tasks that an efficienlty speed up their work productivity, yet having no knowledge of what is going on beneath the screen. It&rsquo;s strange to think that we can operate at this layer of abstraction while not worrying, not even that, not realizing we have to worry about the underneath layers and our vast, vast ignorance of the truth beneath the surface. This peeling of abstraction, in some sense, Is exactly what I am doing to the concept of educational system in this essay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3"></span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c3">Lastly, the expansion of knowledge is neither a morally neutral phenomenon. Knowledge is a tool, unlike some may say &ldquo;knowledge is power&rdquo;.</span></p><div class="c5"><p class="c2"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c3">Notes: One can safely argue that the ability to think, write, and speak requires knowledge to perform those tasks in a refined manner. However, in my understanding, many people can be great thinkers, writers, and speakers without ever gaining the knowledge of how to be one, nor be able to teach it to other people. This is not to say you can not learn to be better at these things, which&nbsp; requires the acquisition of knowledge, however, it is strange to categorize these human capabilities as &quot;knowledge&quot;, although you can, for the they are&nbsp; human ways to process and communicate objective knowledge. All and all, it is a problem of categorization for my model, which for all that I care, is to demonstrate the learning process which I will talk about later. In summary, there isn&#39;t much point of arguing over such things :).</span></p></div></body></html>
