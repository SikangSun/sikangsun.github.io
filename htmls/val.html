Every country in the world possesses such a system, with the aim of developing the minds of the upcoming generation. This system, so immense in size, so dense in complexity, practiced cross-culturally, unequivocally, and undisputedly, what in the world can possibly require validation? </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">In my estimation: about everything. By everything, I mean its fundamental purpose, which like many other intrinsic systems that we have incorporated into our lives, many people were never required to learn their purpose, and perhaps for good reasons, one being their terrible complexities. However, for one to change something for the better, one must break components down into their most essential truths, an approach that is fundamental to fields such as physics and mathematics (and of course, computer science for my case, for it is built upon the foundation of discrete mathematics). With these irrefutable truths, one then may be able to aim with something more steady at hand. And it is for this, after it all, I have come to the terrible conclusion, that it is as if the only way to validate the education system is to invalidate it. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">By no means do I think the current system should be forcibly torn down by artificial forces of any kind. However, I am not unbiased for I am honest about my frustration against this current system, in which I have the privilege of participating. In fact, if not for this frustration, I would have never bothered to write down a single letter to express my dissatisfaction, for there would be no dissatisfaction to spew. But before so, there are parameters that I would like to define clearly. First, I would not go into the social, economical, and even political criticisms of the current system, albeit there are many, of which I have a lot less confident speaking, and there already exist solid arguments made against them. Second, I would solely be speaking about collegiate education, more specifically, undergraduate level, perhaps even graduate (albeit I don&rsquo;t have personal experience), for they are both in the same system, public and private alike, and of which I am currently a part of. Third, I would like to attempt to bring forth an argument that identifies a particular problem, and the last thing it should be is a cheap jab at the enormously complex system that has nurtured and will nurture millions of citizens. And hopefully, focusing on identifying the problem, will in turn avoid the last thing I would like this essay to become.</span></p><p class="c0 c5 c11"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">\/</span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.p5gzx8v8h8px"><span class="c7">A Framework for Knowledge</span></h2><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">It seems to me to begin the topic of education statement, we need to start elsewhere, at the nature of knowledge. Note that the following is my arbitrary framework to understand knowledge, and by no means is it perfect. The concept of knowledge is a human construct, as knowledge will not exist without human ignorance. Let us imagine an image of all possible knowledge. The image is mostly covered by a dark shade, representing the unknown, of which in the middle is an area of no particular shape that is bright and white, the known (although the relative size between the known and unknown is not imaginable). We can interpret the bright area as the abstraction of the summation of all known human knowledge. As humans discover the universe, the area of known grows, converting the chaotic unknown into ordered territories. We can also abstract the idea into a multidimensional context, where each dimension can be interpreted as a field of study (eg. physics, mathematics, psychology, etc), albeit there is no absolute way of categorizing every field. In that sense, each dimension will represent the amount of knowledge a field of study contains. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This abstraction can then be applied to the context of an individual. Because the area of human knowledge is the summation of all possible human knowledge, the area of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge will be a subset of that, and one can reasonably infer, that the area of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge is much lesser than that of the total summation of human beings. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>On the scale of an individual, it&rsquo;s much easier to conduct thought experiments. Imagine you are in a class in high school, let&#39;s say algebra. Then learning the euclidean coordinates and different graphs will expand one&rsquo;s domain in the dimension of mathematics. However, knowledge in mathematics isn&rsquo;t the only thing that is growing. Exercises that help build knowledge in certain domain may also help with one&rsquo;s problem-solving skills, refines one&rsquo;s thinking process, or develop one&rsquo;s capability in thinking, writing, and speaking</span><span>, These abilities, although are not strictly fields of knowledge themselves, are crucial to one&rsquo;s success in career and life.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The gained knowledge, especially the foundational knowledge that I like to refer to as &ldquo;school of thought&rdquo;, helps interpret the complexity of the world. When one has enough pool of one &ldquo;school of thought&rdquo; that of any field of study (eg. philosophy, physics, mathematics), one can then see the world through the built knowledge and interpret accordingly. This is where specialization of knowledge comes in, where people can offer different points of view to one problem that lie in many dimensions of fields of study.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">As mentioned that the gained knowledge helps interpret the complexity of the world, another effect of knowledge is the unveiling the abstractions. I have personal experience as a computer science student. When I took computer science in high school, it was introductory coding. There were layers of abstractions of which we are learning, and as I learned more and more in college, these abstractions were peeled away bit by bit, like how high-level programming languages are compiled into assembly, how the operating system allocates memory for programs, and how hardware devices act accordingly to machine code. The concept of abstraction is essential to computer science. This abstraction lets ordinary people with no experience in computers able to use user interfaces on their devices and carry out tasks that exponentially speed up their productivity, yet have no knowledge of what is happening beneath the screen. It&rsquo;s strange to think that we can operate at this layer of abstraction while not worrying, not even that, not realizing we have to worry about the underneath layers and our vast ignorance of the truth beneath the surface. This peeling of abstraction, in some sense, Is exactly what I am doing to the concept of the educational system in this essay.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Lastly, knowledge is a tool, unlike some may say &ldquo;knowledge is power&rdquo;. Whether an axe chops a tree or a person is up to the wielder. Furthermore, the expansion of knowledge is a morally neutral phenomenon. The progress in nuclear science, which led to the invention of nuclear weapons, is a peculiar subject to categorize morally. Should people stop expanding their knowledge? The answer to that isn&rsquo;t yes or no, but rather I don&rsquo;t see any way that could happen (in fact, I would actively argue against attempts to stop advancement of knowledge, though it is not a argument of any popularity currently. Perhaps it is something to look out for in the future?). If people are going to explore further and further, it is clear that there are going to be unintended consequences, despite, undoubtedly as it has shown, making the world a better place. If such expansion brought humanity to the brink of nuclear war, can one be certain that knowing more wouldn&rsquo;t bring us to a place even more deadly than that? Stopping its track will never be an option, nevertheless, I cannot help but frown ever so slightly when I hear one righteously declares his dedication to his journey to the places of unknown knowledge. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">\/</span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.25dbg4g0murb"><span class="c7">A Purpose Lost</span></h2><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The educational system has many responsibilities, however, I doubt, almost certainly, that these ideas were built upon consciously, for these are nothing more than my interpretations. However, after my observations in my everyday life in college, and some time before that, of how teachers, students, and administrators act, I wish to argue that in another sense, these interpretations are more true than those intentions that the educational system is built upon (perhaps limited to my school, but I am willing to go and say that it applies to most of the American universities, especially public), for intentions and believes do not usually manifest themselves reflectively in practice, but very few things are more true than how people act. Hence I decide to go backward, from how people act to what the purpose truly is. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Responsibility is a heavy term, yet ever so lifting, unshakable, and noble. These responsibilities aren&rsquo;t just what the school should do, but rather what it </span><span class="c8">owes</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;to the students. Failing to reach these ideals should be considered a moral erring, for the existence of this system requires many resources from each student, family, alumni, and the government (who gets their resources from taxe&hellip;. *cough* the people). Such trust lies on a heavy pillar that upholds the social fabric; we know this because politicians speak and preach of funneling money down the drain that is the educational system; and as far as I am concerned, when there is something politicians of both parties preach, the topic is largely accepted as good by the public.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">But what specifically are these responsibilities, other than the obvious answer of &ldquo;educate the students&rdquo;? What is it that allows the public to rightfully entrust the institution as so valuable that cannot be attained anywhere else? </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Take the knowledge model spoken of earlier. In short, the education system constructs an orderly pathway that allows students to solidify unknown knowledge at the edge of their capability. Each and every class builds on top of some other knowledge, be it basic arithmetic, fluency in languages, or knowledge in specific fields. In other words, classes stand on the edge of an individual&rsquo;s knowledge capacity and provide methods that allow students to learn easier than otherwise (methods such as lectures, homework, worksheets, essays, etc). </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To understand this idea, one should also understand the art of learning, for it is the fundamental reason why one goes to school. Image a bridge made up solely of ropes (ones that you may find at a playground), however. only the structure exists, where the floor of the bridge is still hardly built. One may consider standing on one side of the bridge, at a place of known knowledge, whereas the other side is the unknown, the better place you would like to get to. When one takes a class, he is provided the structure of the bridge, however, to fill up the floor, he would need to lay layers of ropes to make a walkway. He can do so by studying, perhaps he will lay a layer by previewing before lectures, another laying of listening attentively during lectures, perhaps another when doing the homework, and another by going to professors and teaching assistants to ask for help. With each layer, the bridge becomes more stable, and despite being made out of ropes, one has less and less chance of falling through an unpatched hole the more or sturdier layers he lays. When he reaches the other side, he can then use his newfound knowledge for something useful or confront a larger and scarier unbuilt bridge.This process occurs in every classroom, at the edge between the known and the unknown.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The process of learning isn&rsquo;t easy, however, a large portion of an educational institution&rsquo;s purpose is to provide a framework of which students can proceed to learn, or in the context of the example, provide a structure where the students can build on top of. If one were to self-learn anything, it will largely come from books or the internet, where such structure does not exist, meaning instead of focusing on &ldquo;what to learn&rdquo;, the individual will have to spend a large chunk of time learning &ldquo;where to learn&rdquo; and &ldquo;how to learn&rdquo; instead. Every now and then, he may be stopped by roadblocks, where such resource does not exist and there is no one he can go to overcome his niche difficulties. This is what is valuable, in terms of learning, for the education system, for there exists someone that teaches, someone that provides a structure for learning. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This sets the most fundamental responsibility of the education system, which is: to provide a meta-structure of learning that spans many courses. One can interpret this as the major/minor system in Universities, such as the required classes one must take, electives to broaden your horizon of knowledge, order of pre-requisites and high-level courses, etc. This is the meta structure that orders the individual class, for knowledge builds upon each other. Imagine the department designing a new major. The designer needs to go through what are the essential modules of knowledge that students must learn to receive a degree (a certificate that proves your understanding of knowledge) from the University. He then goes through knowledge that closely ties to each other, and makes them into individual classes that take place in an orderly structure within a predetermined period of time (semesters). Students learn knowledge sequentially through this order of classes with the idea of making sure each class expands the student&rsquo;s understanding right beyond the limit of their knowledge, and not some area of the unknown that has no relation to what the student previously understood, where he has no approach or tools to utilize to understand what is newly taught. In conclusion, this meta-structure takes away the complexity of &ldquo;how to learn&rdquo; away from the students. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This structure is what is valuable about the system, something one can hardly get from anywhere else, something students would sacrifice sleepless nights for, something parents would willingly pay a fortune for. The main purpose of the current education system is hence: to provide a meta-framework for learning. The idea of gaining knowledge for future jobs securely, which is the core mission statement of any University (if a University does not do that, it should and does not exist), is a modern idea, before which (although I have no idea when the transition happened), the idea of gaining knowledge isn&rsquo;t largely about gaining skillsets for a job, but about gaining knowledge itself. I am in no way saying that learning for job security is a bad thing, however, it lies where the problem begins.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">\/</span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.wy9zqcjnq4c7"><span class="c7">Forced Abstraction for Complexity</span></h2><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Universities hold a lot of people, subsequently, attention to each individual student is undisputedly divided. Furthermore, in order to certify students of their knowledge, standardized assessments take place to verify students&rsquo; understanding of the course material. These assessments are supposed to evaluate students&rsquo; knowledge, and an entire scale that is accepted across-nationally is created for such evaluation (eg. GPA and the grading scale). A good assessment is supposed to compare the student&rsquo;s current holding knowledge to what is expected from coming out from taking the respective class. Of course, there exist flaws with such an approach, but the main constraints are the human and time resources of the universities and the departments. It seems like it is largely the most effective approach, after all, it is still in use today in most of the technical classes in Universities. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Class. Grades. Graduate with a degree. At some point, the streamlining process has taken over. The purpose of learning ceased being to gain knowledge for better use, but the line of logic &ldquo;get good grades, pass classes, graduate with a degree, get a job&rdquo;. How many students stop to ask themselves: &ldquo;why am I learning what I am learning&rdquo;? More often than not, the answer is to pass the class than to learn what the class has to offer. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is wrong. It is counter-logical to the extreme, but how did this become what it is? I believe as universities became more and more popular after secondary education, schools are faced with high demand with limited resources. That demand is exactly the credible backing of an institution, which is what a degree represents. This one piece of paper separates one from one crowd into another during the job hunting process, because recruiters simply do not have the resources to assess the wide range of human capabilities of the entire applicant pool (i.e. another complexity problem). However, with years of learning and approval from an institution, recruiters can safely guess that the particular applicant has some knowledge under his belt. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">This is the demand, and all that Universities are doing is in responding to the demand. These schools require tuition and public subsidies to stay afloat, both cannot happen without the flow of incoming students every year. However, Universities rarely have enough resources to specifically accommodate every single student, hence they construct a system in place to provide the streamlining process for students to earn their desired degrees. As the size of the Universities grew, the complexities are divided to better fit the interests of students (e.g. creating new departments/majors).</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">So far so good. In my estimation, there isn&rsquo;t particularly wrong with how things are laid out. However, this setup leads to the inevitable fact of the resource of each individual class are limited to a horrible degree. Even if one professor were to have a class of dozen students, it is already demanding to demand the professor keep track of each student&rsquo;s levels of knowledge throughout their time of learning, let alone two dozen, three dozen, multiply that by two classes, three classes. To demand such standards from teachers is ridiculous (is it ridiculous, or we are just so used to what we have?), nonetheless, this means an abstraction must be made, an abstraction that inevitably marginalizes each student to different degrees, to accommodate the number of students. &nbsp;An abstraction to the point the professor does not even know the names of the students he is teaching.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>This abstraction is exactly the grading scale, an attempt to capture the student&rsquo;s level of knowledge in the class. Important word: </span><span class="c8">attempt.</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;Grades are a fundamentally flawed way to assess one&rsquo;s understanding of the subject, at least, more flawed than having an assessment tailored to each individual. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">To fulfill the demand, the Universities have an active incentive have pushed students through each class at the end of each semester. With the grading system, the teacher can assign a letter to each student&rsquo;s understanding and pass them on to the next stage of their learning journey. This grading scale is also then used by recruiters, and higher-level education systems, to determine the quality of the student. This scale creates a hierarchy within the Universities that differentiates the good and bad students to some degree, as it correlates (to some degree, however flawed it may be) to the future success of the student. For that, students fight like hell for a better grade, trying to get a bump up when they just miss the cutoff, because they know it will make a difference in their career (even if they don&rsquo;t believe it does, they certainly act as if they do).</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Thus born the new purpose, one that centers around the distribution of grades and the pursuit of the top of the hierarchy. However, here lies the heart of the problem: the grading system is absolutely arbitrary. I am not saying that one who aces the test is just as good as the person who fails it, but the single fact there is no consensus on how to teach and assess the student&rsquo;s understanding of the knowledge, as every single professors operates every single class differently, the grade itself may as well as be arbitrary.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">\/</span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.djfmkjvf3x32"><span class="c7">Consequences of the Grade-Centered System</span></h2><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Transitions are hard.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Let&rsquo;s talk about curve instead.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>One cannot talk about grades at the collegiate level without speaking about the </span><span class="c9">curve</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;(italicized), for everything depends on the curve. Not your score on the midterms or finals; not how many lectures you chose to sleep through; not how many homeworks you managed to ace; and lastly, certainly not about how much you actually know about the material, for before the curve distribution is released, no one is certain about the outcome of their grades.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Curve is the shift in bias and skew of the grade distribution. A flast curve moves the distribution along the axis of grade cutoffs (in other words, moves the bias of the distribution), and an unfair curve aim to fix the skew of the distribution. But why are curves needed in the first place?</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">With the demand from the students, the college face the challenge of somehow assign a non-arbitrary grading to every students using an arbitrary scale.This proves to be especially hard to do, considering the changing of structures of each class that occurs nearly every semester (professor, TAs, materials, etc), which also imply an unpredictable fluctuation in the quality of the class every semester. In fact, it is incomprehensible to think about the fact that the change of a single professor can make the experience of a single class almost entirely night and day. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">The curve is the antidote to the problem of variability. There are three things that determines the general grade distribution of a class: the quality of the students, the difficulty of the course material, and the quality of the teaching staffs. If we assume the quality of the student is held constant, and that the course material is not changed drastically between different professors (which usually they are not), the only variance will be caused by the teaching staff. In other words, a large amount of responsibility of the bias in the grade distribution is supposed to fall upon the teaching staffs. But with curve, there is no &ldquo;null hypothesis&rdquo;, the baseline where you can compare the quality of the professors, as the percentage of cutoffs is usually determined by the past semesters. I am not here to argue ways to set up a hierarchy of professors and let the system sort out the quality from the nots (albeit it may very well be a good idea, but with the bureaucratic set up we have currently, I don&rsquo;t see that particularly happening), but focus on the consequences of the grades on students, and the amount of knowledge taught and absorbed.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The very obvious and illogical thing about the curve: if grades are supposed to represent the level of understanding of the knowledge, then with the introduction of the curve, </span><span class="c8">your understanding of the knowledge only so far as to exist in relative to other people</span><span class="c2">, which is illogical in the most fundamental sense. Teachers and seekers of the knowledge and truths, is this what you have wanted? Where your understanding only matters so long it is more than the person you are sitting next to? Isn&rsquo;t there a meta-goal that one is working towards through it all, or is that just &ldquo;too complicated&rdquo; for people to understand? As a pragmatist, I wonder if such method of approach is ever used as an excuse so people can look away from what is supposedly too abstract to understand.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>The arbitrary number of percentage of students to receive certain grades also imposes a restriction, a restriction so appalling that I can scarcely begin to understand the mind of people who make these decisions. Introducing my algorithms professor, Dr. P. He is young, has a decent humor, and is a great lecturer. Considering he is an assistant professor yet given the task of teaching one of the most fundamental course for Computer Science majors at my University should goes to speak of his level of competence. I&rsquo;ve heard this story in one semester, the average scores was so high in his class that he received immense pressure from the department, who forced him to artificially increase the difficulty of the exams, all just to fit the percentage of the cutoffs that the curve demands. Now, does this sound like an environment that incentivize good professors to you? Afterall (</span><span class="c9">as I write in an ironic voice</span><span class="c2">), every single semester is the same, only some number of students deserve to get certain grades, and the professors are only there to regorgitate the material and wait for students to regorgitate back to them. It is not as if there is some meaning at the boundary of introducing to new generations of students to the most fundamental parts of a school of thought, struggled painstakingly by intellectuals and thinkers before us through the course of history; and the best you can give me when an educator has done a phenomenal job such that students are seemingly performing better than usual years, is to quash the creativity, competence, and hard work with all your might just so that some arbitrary number is not to exceed the previous years? This is the consequence of the corruption of grades and lossing sight of what was truly important, where that search for knowledge is nowhere to be found; what is left is the diminishing void that is the credibility of the institution and a string of border-line comical letters that are supposedly approved by the most capable educators in the country.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span>Lastly, I want to talk about the </span><span class="c9">illusion of effort</span><span>. In Computer Science, there is little correlation between on how long you work on a function and how well that function will run. In other words, </span><span class="c8">the best way to complete the task is the best way to complete the task</span><span class="c2">. We have this misconception when it comes to student spending time in learning the course, that somehow the longer the time spent the better the student is. I would argue the opposite is true. In an environment dedicated to learning, the way to learn knowledge should be made as concise as possible to approach, not in some long, convoluted roundabouts. If both students and teaching staffs&rsquo;s time runs on money, then shouldn&rsquo;t the education system strive for most amount of knowledge taught in the least amount of time? This is not just talking about busy work or meaningless assignments, but rather, the tendency of people confusing effort and efficiency. If the student can demonstrate that he knows all of the knowledge and can learn it in such way better than all other students, then why reprimand him for not &ldquo;put in as enough effort&rdquo; for his grades? I believe some part to this is also the ego of the teaching staffs, be it the professor or teaching assistance, who have justified to thsmselves, consciously or unconsciously, that somehow students are there to serve them and not the other way around, therefore so unabashedly and almost proudfully demand their time in the name of education.</span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c2">. \/</span></p><h2 class="c1" id="h.518c0os8n4us"><span class="c7">Afterword</span></h2><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">If you have made it this far, thank you for reading. </span></p><p class="c0 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">I have originally planned to write more about consequences and addressing some counter-arguments, however, I realized that most of it will get into ways to reform the system, of which I have not thought about enough just yet (and even if I have, it&rsquo;s a darn daunting task to argue for).
