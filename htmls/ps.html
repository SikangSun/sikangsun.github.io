Gravity pulled on my broken guitar string perpendicularly toward the ground, a somewhat awkward sight to see in the middle of a school culture festival performance, to say the least. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">But I couldn&rsquo;t care enough at that point. I sighed silently as I stared up at the ceiling of the stage, at last letting out moments of stress that have overtaken me just seconds ago. The blazing stage lights brightened my face for the first time, blinding scattering parts of my vision peripheral. The cool air of the gym&rsquo;s air conditioning stuck to my skin, however, that didn&rsquo;t stop moisture from forming in the center of my palms and the side of my neck. The contrast between cold and heat threw me in a loop, and for a fraction of a second, I couldn&rsquo;t tell what was real.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yeah, that&rsquo;s right. It all seems so surreal. Never would I have thought I would be playing in front of hundreds of people at my school&rsquo;s culture festival, yet here I am. How many times have I agonized, distressed, and regretted the fear of stage performance and social interactions? Perhaps I never truly believed that I could step out of this lonely circle of mine. But despite it all, be it the nerve-wracking part of the service job at the club, or being put in for the street performance that I did not sign up for in the first place, I wouldn&rsquo;t trade this band of misfits for anything in the world. Amidst the moment, perhaps the only organized thought was the dread of this years-old dream coming to an end, </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;As the night falls, I dream that unlikely dream&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Familiar lyrics filled the void of my mind, dragging me from Narnia back to reality. Just like we practice dozens and dozens of times, the sound of alternating kick drum and hi-hat tingled my ears. Without the companioning bass and guitar, the stage almost fell as quiet as the seconds we looked for each other&rsquo;s eyes before the song started, the only difference being Kita-san&rsquo;s voice vibrating through the cool, crispy air. An odd sense of meaning precipitated like residuals at the bottom of my heart. Never have I thought the mundane silence that I have long gotten used to could be so meaningful. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Seconds seemed to be moving slower than usual. I looked over my right shoulder to find its source. Kita-san stood in the center of the stage, forcibly grabbing all the attention of the gym by herself. I might never be able to do that, I thought as my vision focused on nothing in particular, being in the middle of the spotlight and all. But with the glances she shot me between looking down at the guitar during her freestyle, I couldn&rsquo;t help but think she was trying to force the whole world to notice my existence in that wordless exchange. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The amps sent Kita-san&rsquo;s voice to every corner of the gym. I wrote the lyrics myself, yet I still feel uneasy at the fact it is being sung on stage. Is that what is truly bothering me? I thought to myself in this moment that seems to drag on forever. A mixture of nervousness, excitement, and unrealness swam in my chest. My teenage dream is playing out right in front of me. In the back of my mind, I realized the reason behind my restlessness. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">The white bass guitar tucked away two quiet notes</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Not quite a full moon, but&hellip;&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">At the end of this performance, I will be saying goodbye to a part of my old self. A part of myself that dreamed the same dream for far too long, who did not, and probably still do not, have the courage to handle what is about to come. A sense of loss surfaced in my pool of emotions. Am I truly ready to lose her? How is the present me any different? What will I dream of tomorrow when I still can&rsquo;t handle what is in front of me today? &nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Another note whispered by the white bass, hinting at my entrance. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I still couldn&rsquo;t quite understand how I have made it this far, yet I felt as if I could feel the unexplainable answer reaching out to my mourning silence. The drum that has pulled me out of my lonely despair; the bass that has told me to write the lyrics that follow my heart; and the vibrant voice that has quietly edged me on to take the spotlight; perhaps I was an idiot for that one moment as if I needed to search for the answer that was in front of my eyes. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I slowly looked downwards, back towards my one-missing-string guitar. The vocals entered half a beat earlier. I leaned into my entrance, lifting up the melody as we approached the end of our song. The broken string swayed to its content.</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">&ldquo;... still lighting up the dark.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span>Although the seconds seemed to stretch on in slow motion, I felt as if I was still caught off guard entering into the climax. It didn&rsquo;t bother me, however, as I poured all my emotions into the </span><span class="c8">crescendo-ing </span><span class="c0">strings. I sensed the presence of the crowd beyond my dangling bang, but the pressure it usually exerted did not reach me, for I was no longer alone. That was perhaps the calmest second I spent on the stage that day </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Thank you, my past self. I silently bid farewell to my imaginary ego. </span></p><p class="c1 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">I did not know what is in store for the future, but with these three&hellip; I&rsquo;m sure the new dream tomorrow will shine just as bright as the constellation stars. &nbsp;</span></p></body></html>
