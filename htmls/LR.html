Wait! Wait! That&rsquo;s not what I meant!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The dark-haired girl walked in front of me, with a hasty pace unusual to her demeanor. We have strictly followed the brochure that Takina made for the day, jumping from one thing to another like some special mission. Are shopping trips supposed to be this stressful? Of course not! It&rsquo;s supposed to be relaxing and fun, so what&rsquo;s up with the hustle Takina?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Well, to give my partner a bit of credit, today has been fun. The last time when we hung out like this was probably all the way back during the summer. Back then, Takina was even less playful, and look at her now! She&rsquo;s got a brochure, a plan, and everything! How far she has come these few short months. Oh, how proud of her I am! You&rsquo;ve grown, Takina, you&rsquo;ve grown.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I satisfyingly nodded to myself, although the image was probably a lot less imageable since I had three and a half pancakes in my mouth. Her long black hair rested softly on her back, only caring to move at the slightest with each step she took. The yellow wool sweater contrasted well with her oversized beige jacket underneath. Her long dark navy blue dress dangled peacefully in the early winter wind. I attentively watched the way she walked, a gait of complete confidence yet with a hint of innocence. The crisp sound of her heels tugged my heartstring as I unconsciously synced my steps with hers. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But even with all of the reasoning, I still couldn&rsquo;t fathom&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Why are we running around in such a hurry?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;That&rsquo;s &nbsp;a secret.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A curt response, as usual. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I grumpily chewed on my pancakes. The balcony offered a great few to the rest of the plaza. Family, couples, and friends were all enjoying their day of retreat. There are very few things that I like more than this peace and quietness. It&rsquo;s not that I don&rsquo;t like exciting things or poking my head into trouble, okay? But this calm happiness is something I wish everyone can learn to treasure, even just a tiny bit. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Suddenly the dark-haired girl frozen, quickly came back to her sense and ran forward until she stopped in front of a message board by the aquarium. She wore a shocking expression that I rarely get to see from her, which quickly turned into sore disappointment and borderline melancholy. The large letters bolded with red highlights struck a blow at the girl&rsquo;s heart. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I smiled as I beckoned Takina to follow me. Surely a day such as this can&rsquo;t be ruined by small obstacles like that!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Takina turned toward me with an unsure expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Oh, I forgot to mention! That red cap of hers is also super cute!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c9"><span class="c0">I was the one that put her outfit together, after all. Hehe.</span></p><p class="c8 c9"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c10"><span class="c0">\/</span></p><p class="c7 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I have been restless ever since I heard how much time Chisato has left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">My initial ignition and resentment were utterly shut down by Chisato. That doesn&rsquo;t mean they have gone away, just hidden away under a thin layer of facade, ready to burst at a moment&rsquo;s notice. However, in front of Chisato, it turns into a sense of anxiousness, dread, and uneasiness. Even so, her carefree persona is still able to take my mind away from the dreading subject, even for just a moment. Perhaps I still haven&rsquo;t fully grasped the fact that this ever-so-lively girl only has less than two months to live. It seems like nothing more than a fever dream as if life is playing an irrational and childish game on us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">We sat quietly on a stone bench beside the pond. I didn&#39;t expect a shopping mall to have this kind of facility. My thoughts drifted as time passed. The usual dread, that I have almost gotten accustomed to in the past few days, returned predictably. I haven&rsquo;t been able to focus at all; during missions, services, or even alone, my thoughts have only been about Chisato. The idea of losing her depresses me to no end, and it only greedily drags me in deeper and deeper. This hopeless cycle haunts me while I carry my usual composure, taking away my attentiveness at the direst time. In the end, it&rsquo;s always Chisato who has to cover for me, only making matters worse. I hate this. Perhaps anything as real as this dreadfulness of the moment, is this feeling of immense loathing that I last experienced when I was fired from DA. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">It wasn&rsquo;t like this even just a few months ago. Something has changed ever since I came to the cafe. This family-like group of people has offered me a refuge like no other, and under their influence, I have unconsciously tried to learn the ways of everyday life. To have fun, give back, and volunteer, I could hardly imagine that I was the same person a few months before. Something has changed, and even I have noticed it. Something so deep and gripping that makes me want to leave the life of DA behind me. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And yet, it&rsquo;s so painful at the same time. Never have I been able to see into the future like this, to imagine what I would like to do, for me and for others. But life is so cruel, filled with people&rsquo;s irrationalism and malevolence. Even if I were to choose, how does one ever endure it all? How can one find the reason to sustain them through this tragedy? The questions plagued me. Voices screamed by my ears, demanding an answer which I didn&rsquo;t have. It&rsquo;s too much. It&rsquo;s&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s my style to enjoy times of trouble.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The bird-chirping like sound washed my anxiousness away. I refocused my attention on my fishing rod. Nothing much happened when I was lost in thought, yet, I don&rsquo;t hate this feeling of peacefulness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Nothing&rsquo;s biting.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Seems like it.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I paused for a moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Are you having fun?&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Yes, I am.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Chisato said with a slight giggle.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;It&rsquo;s fun when I&rsquo;m with you, Takina.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I turned to look at her. The side of her face showed her usual grin at the end of her lips. Her lightheartedness has never died down despite it all. Her melody-like voice changes the room every time she speaks. Yet again, Chisato saved me again from this terrible dreadfulness. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">A reason, right? At that moment, I realized, it was because&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Bzzzzzzzzz&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">&ldquo;Oh, it&rsquo;s time.&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">Only one more thing left on the brochure. I couldn&rsquo;t help but let out a small sigh. My train of thought soon caught back up to me. A reason&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0">I looked out at Chisato, and at that moment, something shifted in my heart, as if it has found its last missing pieces.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5"><span class="c0">\/</span></p><p class="c5 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">You know, I would say I&rsquo;m a pretty selfish person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, I have people that I care about, like teach, Mizuki, and everyone that comes by the cafe. To everyone else that I don&rsquo;t see eye to eye, I can&rsquo;t help but be cheeky with them, you know? And even to those who I care about, I&rsquo;m sure I have caused them a fair amount of trouble as well. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Hey, you have to give me some leeway, okay? I don&rsquo;t have much time left anyways!</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Of course, I could never say that. It would just bring down the whole room. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">But Takina is different. She is the first friend I had of my own age. She&rsquo;s smart, mature, and &hellip; a tiny bit of an airhead, but that&rsquo;s why she&rsquo;s special. If it wasn&rsquo;t for all of these things, she and I wouldn&rsquo;t have become friends and have had some much fun together. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I regret nothing, nothing at all. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">That&rsquo;s why&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">The noises of the train tracks sank in as we approached our final destination for the day. I sneaked a glance her way. The winter dusk brightened her face, as she quietly stared at the never-ending suburban scenery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I know Takina will return to the DA.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">All of this: the abrupt day off, summer dresses, clothes shopping, restaurant, aquarium; it&rsquo;s like she&rsquo;s trying to draw the perfect conclusion. She must have put a lot of thought into this. &nbsp;And I had so much fun too, all thanks to her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">And it&rsquo;s only because of this, that I could never ask her to stay. I once said to her that a chance will come one day when she will get to choose, and she has made her choice. How my selfishness gnaws at my inactions, but if it is Takina, this last sacrifice will surely be worth it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">How much I just wish that&hellip; this day would last a little bit longer. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">I caught a short glance of Takina&rsquo;s dark violet eyes. It may have just been my mistake, but deep within those eyes, beneath the glimmering hope and determination, was a slimmer of gut-wrenching pain.</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c5 c3"><span class="c0">\/</span></p><p class="c4 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">I am returning to DA. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">But not for the sake of the DA&rsquo;s will. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">For a long time, I lived by DA&rsquo;s generosity. I was in debt to the DA, and perhaps I still am. &nbsp;It was a place that I belong, where I could call &ldquo;home&rdquo;. I could live by its purpose, and sacrifice myself for all that I cared. Missions, comrades, and that fountain, It was all I had, after all. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">And yet, after all this, I am leaving Chisato behind, for the slightest chance of saving her heart. These last few precious, precious months, all gambled away as I walked down those stairs. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">I regret nothing, nothing at all. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">I was sick of being anxious, despite not being able to help myself. I&rsquo;m leaving her behind, yet she was the one who brought me this far. I will return to the place of my corrupted past willfully sacrificing all that I have.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">As the first pellets of snow flew into my vision, I instinctively turned around. Of course, there she was, standing at the other end of the stairs. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Her smile was ever so dazzling. Brighter than the night street lights. Brighter than the first winter snow. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">The reason I could do this&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">it is all because of you, Chisato. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">It is because of you, that I have something to cherish.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">It is because of you, that I have found the courage to look into the future.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">It is because of you, that my life was changed upside down. And I regret nothing, nothing at all.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">I smiled back at her. We didn&rsquo;t speak a word, for words could only fail to convey what it meant. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">The dreadful, anxious, melancholic, and depressive thoughts all left me at once. For the first time in my life, I chose my own purpose, and she stood right in front of me. I could feel the intense hope inside of me, bursting in my chest so much so I could barely breathe. </span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">As I turned around and took my last glance off of her, I swore to myself; I spoke it from so deep within me that I could afford to have God as a witness.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">I will save you, Chisato.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">So&hellip;.</span></p><p class="c1 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0">Wait for me.</span></p></body></html>
